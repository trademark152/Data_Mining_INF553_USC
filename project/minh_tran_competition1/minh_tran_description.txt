The model follows closely the guidance in HW3. User-based collaborative filtering is utilized. To predict a rating of a business B by user U, gather similar users to U based on how they rate businesses in general; then evaluate that set of users how they rate buusiness B and deduce how U might rate B. Ratings are normalized by the average. Exception for pair of (user U, business B) is handled as followed: 
 if B has not been rated by any user and U have not rated any business, assign 3.0. 
 if B has not been rated by any user, assign rating of average rating of user U 
 if U has not rated any business, assign rating of average rating of business B.
